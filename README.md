# Usage

Add the following step to a GitHub workflow file:
```
- uses: concord-consortium/s3-deploy-action@main
  with:
    bucket: models-resources
    prefix: name-of-project
    awsAccessKeyId: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    awsSecretAccessKey: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    topBranches: |
      ["main"]
```
You should replace `name-of-project` with the repository name.

This will build the code with `npm run build`, and then copy the output in `dist` up to
S3. The location in S3 depends on if this is a branch or tag:
- If it is a branch it will be:
`models-resources/name-of-project/branch/[branch-name]`
- If it is a tag it will be:
`models-resources/name-of-project/version/[tag-name]`

The list of branches in topBranches will have their `index-top.html` file copied and
renamed with the branch name.
So in this case, if the main branch is pushed,
`models-resources/name-of-project/branch/main/index-top.html` will be copied
to `models-resources/name-of-project/index-main.html`

You can see an example of this being used in this PR:
https://github.com/concord-consortium/starter-projects/pull/37

Note: we should release the action so the first line can refer to a version instead of
`@main`.  Currently there are no releases.

# Develop

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 9, for instance.

Install the dependencies  
```bash
$ npm install
```

Build, test, and package for distribution
```bash
$ npm run all
```

## action.yml

The action.yml defines the inputs and output for this action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Use new GH Action packages

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we need to checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
$ npm run all
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

The action is now published! :rocket:

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

The action is used in this repository by the test job in [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml)
Currently this test job does nothing more than just build itself.

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/concord-consortium/s3-deploy-action/actions) for runs of this action.
